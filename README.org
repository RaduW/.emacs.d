#+TITLE: Durant's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Durant Schoon

The configuration depends on Org mode. [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]], which is where the majority of the configuration magic happens.

Gratitude to Daniel Mai for showing me his awesome set up and making some Emacs tutorials with me: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGM8KgUXqsS4d8-4rgWRWKg/playlists][Emacculate Playlists]]
